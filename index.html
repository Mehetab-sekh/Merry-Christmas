<p>The presents are wrapped, the tree is decorated and the Christmas dinner is all planned out — but there's probably one thing still left on your holiday checklist: Thinking of what to write in a Christmas card, of course! After all, there's nothing like a classic Christmas card to spread holiday cheer — especially when it's sent with a personalized, handwritten message. “One of the season’s simple pleasures is sitting down with a cup of hot tea and reading the ‘real mail’ holiday cards and letters,” says Jodi R.R. Smith, founder of Mannersmith Etiquette Consulting. “There is something special about holding a piece of paper that was touched by someone you care about.”</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Of course, finding the right words can be tricky — but don't get your jingle bells in a knot! To help you out, we've compiled some of the best Christmas wishes to write in your holiday card, ranging from funny and romantic messages to classic Christmas quotes. And whether you're sending it to your family, friends or co-workers, Smith recommends keeping it short and simple: Summarize an accurate reflection of your positive life events, and feel free to include a Christmas card photo or two. Just don’t forget to “include well wishes to others in addition to your update,” says Smith. “After all, the holiday letter is part of your season's greeting to others.”</p>
